This repository forks xterm.js for the purposes of publishing the [`vscode-xterm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-xterm) module on npm. It's not recommended to use this module as it's based on an unstable version of xterm.js while VS Code in under development.

See [this wiki page](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Working-with-xterm.js) for instructions on how to pull in changes from the upstream project and publish for VS Code.
